This repository contains my training files with source code written in Java.
In this training files we can find micro ORM, that works with Derby Database.
This micro ORM gives you ability to create table objects, insert objects into this tables and getting all objects from this table.
There is no big idea, I just read the book "Thinking in Java" and got the excercise to create mini ORM in the part about Annotations, and decided to try. 

To run this code, you need to find Derby JDBC lib version >8.
